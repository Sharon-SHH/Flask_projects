# Flask Framework
Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. Some key features of Flask included in the all examples:

1. Routing: Flask provides a routing system that allows developers to map URLs to specific functions or views, making it easy to handle different requests and routes within the application.

2. Templating: Flask uses Jinja2 as its template engine, which enables the separation of the application logic from the presentation layer. Templating in Flask allows for dynamic content rendering and the reuse of templates across different pages.

3. HTTP request handling: Flask provides a convenient way to handle HTTP requests, allowing you to access request data, form submissions, cookies, and more.

4. Flask extensions: Flask has a rich ecosystem of extensions that add additional functionality to the framework. These extensions cover various areas such as database integration, authentication, and API development, making it easy to extend Flask's capabilities.
